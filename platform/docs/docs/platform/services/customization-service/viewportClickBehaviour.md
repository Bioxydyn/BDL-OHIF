# Viewport Click Behaviour



The behaviour on clicking on the cornerstone viewport can be customized
by setting the `cornerstoneViewportClickCommands`.  This is intended to
support both the cornerstone 3D internal commands as well as things like
context menus.  Currently it supports buttons 1-3, as well as modifier keys
by associating a commands list with the button to click.  See `initContextMenu`
for more details.
